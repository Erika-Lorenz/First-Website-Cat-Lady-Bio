	<h1>Musings of A Dedicated Cat Lady</h1>

	<p>I'm the cat lady.</p>
	<p>I have always had cats in my house, from the time I was in a crib. I became known as the cat whisperer in my family, and have more patience with these small demons than with anything else. <br><br>
	I guess you could say my cat lady afflication is partially genetic. However, my mother was more of a caregiver to any animal in need. She has a way of finding things to care for, and nourishing them back to health. Of course, by then she is too attached to consider anywhere else as a permanent home for such a soul. <br><br>
	Anyways, I seem to have specialised in cats. I bottle fed sick kittens, nursed injuries, and when I wasn't getting enough work at home (with up to 7 cats at a time!) I decided to volunteer at shelters. <br><br>
	At present, I have two cats at my apartment in Richmond, Nala and Appa. Although they will be a focal point on this website, I have also chosen to include the cats who I hold dear to my heart that do not live with me and those who have passed on. <br><br>
	If you have a love of cats, or even a fondness of animals in general, I hope you find this website fun, if not interesting. It is my first webpage created from scratch, and I wanted something I'm passionate about to be the focus, to help me get through learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br><br>
	Thank you, and enjoy.
	</p>
